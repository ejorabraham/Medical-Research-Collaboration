# Decentralized Medical Research Collaboration

This project implements a blockchain-based platform for secure, transparent collaboration among medical research institutions. The system facilitates data sharing, tracks contributions, and manages intellectual property rights while maintaining appropriate privacy standards for sensitive medical information.

## Core Components

1. **Institution Verification Contract**
    - Validates legitimate research entities through rigorous verification
    - Creates trusted digital identities for participating organizations
    - Establishes reputation metrics based on research history and contributions
    - Ensures regulatory compliance for participating institutions

2. **Data Sharing Contract**
    - Manages secure exchange of research information with granular permissions
    - Implements privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive medical data
    - Creates immutable audit trail of all data access and usage
    - Supports various data types including clinical trials, genomic data, and imaging

3. **Contribution Tracking Contract**
    - Records inputs from various researchers and institutions
    - Quantifies the value and impact of each contribution
    - Creates transparent attribution for all research activities
    - Supports fair allocation of credit in multi-institution studies

4. **Intellectual Property Contract**
    - Manages rights to discoveries and innovations
    - Implements customizable frameworks for IP sharing
    - Creates verifiable timestamps for research milestones
    - Facilitates equitable royalty distribution based on contribution
